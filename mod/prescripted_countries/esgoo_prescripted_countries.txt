	species_bio="They're worse than alien locusts. Grey Goo destroys resources by turning them into more grey goo - more nano machines or whatever matter the grey goo is composed of. It's The Virus for nonliving things - though it may be able to take down living things as well, and likely will turn them into nonliving things if they're in the wrong place (ie: outside). In theory, you can end up with a planetary body made of nothing but grey goo. Physical laws regarding energy, thermodynamics and the like are an obstacle, but even a partial success in this case is likely to suck for everyone involved."
