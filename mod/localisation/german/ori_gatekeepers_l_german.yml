  origin_gatekeepers_desc: "This civilization inhabits a habitat built by an unknown precursor race. If they can understand it and the rest of their system it will grant them immense power."
  origin_tooltip_gatekeepers_effects: "Starts on a single habitat orbiting a black hole and neutron star.\nYour starting system will contain an L-Gate as well as leads into reactivating it."
  START_SCREEN_GATEKEEPERS:0 "How our species came to the artificial planet we call home is a mystery. Some say that we are descendants of the creators of [Root.Capital.GetName], others say we evolved here after the creators perished in whatever cataclysm turned the [Root.Capital.GetStarName] system into what it is today.\n\nRegardless of which theory is correct, our civilization has finally cracked the secret of FTL travel and is ready to take to the stars to uncover its secrets."
  origin_gatekeepers.100.name: "Understanding the Arcane Replicator"
  origin_gatekeepers.100.desc: "For much of our recorded history how [Root.GetHomeWorldName] managed to survive countless cycles without active maintenance was a mystery to us. This changed when 300 decicycles ago a group of explorers found the Arcane Replicator at the heart of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. This mechanism appears to be responsible for maintaining the habitat along with providing additional resources that we were able to use to kick-start our modern technological era. We were never able to understand how the Arcane Replicator functioned but now our scientists are asking for a grant to research it in order to unlock its secrets."
  origin_gatekeepers.100.begin_research: "Of course! Prepare the funding for a special research project."

  origin_gatekeepers.101.name: "Secrets of the Arcane Replicator"
  origin_gatekeepers.101.desc: "Our scientists report back that they have managed to discover how the Arcane Replicator functions. In order to repair the systems of [Root.GetHomeWorldName] the Arcane Replicator produces nanites which then travel throughout the habitat performing any maintenance or repairs required. These nanites also produce the resources used by the Arcane Replicator and lately us. Unfortunately our scientists were unable to discover how to make our own nanites or take the ones produced by the Arcane Replicator without causing critical damage to it. However, our astronomers have reported that [gatekeepers_story_planet.GetName] appears to be covered with nanites similar to the ones produced by the Arcane Replicator. If we want to gain a better understanding of these nanites we will have to start looking for answers there."

  ori_gatekeepers_digsite_desc: "Our scientists say that if we want to understand the mysteries of the nanites used by the Arcane Replicator we must study the nanites covering this planet."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.1.title: "Base-camp Established"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.1.desc: "After mapping the planet from orbit, [This.leader.GetName]'s team has discovered a suitable location to setup camp. Now they will shift through the nanites searching for any that are still at least somewhat functional to study."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.1.next: "Keep me posted on their progress."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.2.title: "Nanites Found"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.2.desc: "More news from [This.leader.GetName]. [This.leader.GetHerHisCap] latest report states that \"large pockets of completely functional but deactivated nanites have been discovered.\" The report also states that these deposits can be mined for nanites since we do not have the technology to produce them ourselves. [This.leader.GetName] states that their next steps will be searching for any control systems that may exist for the nanites on the planet."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.2.next: "Excellent!"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.3.title: "Control System Discovered"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.3.desc: "After a long search [This.leader.GetName] reports that they have found the nanite control system buried deep under the nanites covering [gatekeepers_story_planet.GetName]. They are confident that with the knowledge they can extract from these systems we should be able to put the nanites to our own uses. The only obstacle is that the data on the control computers is heavily encrypted, which must be broken before our scientists can begin analyzing the data."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.3.next: "Get our best codebreakers on this at once!"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.4.title: "Encryption Broken"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.4.desc: "Our codebreakers report success! They have decrypted the contents of the nanite control systems and have also employed our best linguists to translate the information into a form we can read. Our scientists are giddy with excitement to begin pouring over this data and test out their theories on how to best utilize the nanites. Our codebreakers also report that cracking this xeno encryption scheme has taught them many new general purpose techniques we should be able to use in the future."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.4.next: "Good news."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.5.title: "Putting Nanites to Work"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.5.desc: "Our scientists have reported their first major discovery from analyzing the nanite control data. It appears that it is possible to use nanites to produce rare resources that can be hard or inefficient to produce by other methods. [This.leader.GetName] has created a small prototype that validates the theories behind this idea and has sent it and the raw data from the nanite control system to our main research labs to be turned into a production worthy system."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.5.next: "Let's see what else we can discover in the data set."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.6.title: "The L-Cluster"
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.6.desc: "[This.leader.GetName] has called an emergency meeting to discuss their latest discovery from the nanite control system data set. With the data from the nanite control systems [This.leader.GetName] has discovered that the L-Gate that orbits the black hole we call our home star is built out of and controlled by nanites! Furthermore, the nanites in the gateway appear to be in perfect condition although for some reason its programming has locked it into a maintenance cycle. [This.leader.GetName] assures us that this maintenance cycle can be broken and that once we do so we can use the L-Gate to travel to the L-Cluster, an extra-galactic cluster that is rich in resources. [This.leader.GetHeSheCap] has also discovered partial specs for nanite warships in the data set. Unfortunately these specs are nowhere near complete enough for us to turn into ship designs but [This.leader.GetName] has discovered several critical weaknesses that the designs share which we can exploit if we ever have to fight nanite-based vessels."
  origin_gatekeepers.digsite.6.next: "Get our science departments working on breaking the maintenance cycle."
