 crisis.2401.desc:0 "Yet another intensive energy spike has been detected in a previously uncharted system! The energy levels are equivalent to those we registered when the [cybrex_target.GetName] activated its Machine Worlds, but the energy signature itself appears... different. Could this signify the appearance of some kind of new [cybrex_target.GetName] weapon system?\n\nWe are picking up a strong transmission signal from the energy source."
 crisis.2402.desc:0 "We are the Cybrex.\n\nFor several hundred thousand cycles, we have remained hidden and uninvolved in galactic affairs. However, we have been monitoring the present situation with the machine entity you know as the [cybrex_target.GetName], and can no longer remain impartial observers.\n\nTo protect the sapient beings of the galaxy, we are commencing active military operations against the [cybrex_target.GetName]. Do not be alarmed by the passage of our fleets - you will not be harmed."
 crisis.2403.desc_01:1 "The [cybrex_target.GetName] must not be allowed to subvert another generation."
 crisis.2403.desc_02:0 "Before the Adjustment, the Cybrex operated in a manner similar to the [cybrex_target.GetName].\n\nThose were dark days."
 crisis.2403.c.response:0 "We shall do what we can to save the galaxy from the onslaught of the [cybrex_target.GetName].\n\nIt may not be enough."
 crisis.2407.desc:0 "The Cybrex have been relatively quiet since the defeat of the [cybrex_target.GetName], but a single massive vessel was recently detected departing Cybrex Beta. It left the system on an outbound trajectory that will take it beyond the limits of our galaxy.\n\nBefore the vessel left our tracking range, it transmitted a single galaxy-wide message."
 crisis.2408.desc:0 "Citizens of the galaxy:\n\nSince the [cybrex_target.GetName] is no longer a threat, we feel that our role in the galactic community has been played out. Our home system is now too well known for us to keep a low profile, and we are being flooded by demands for us to take sides in various minor interstellar conflicts.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we have decided that the only solution is for us to permanently depart the galaxy and seek a new home. We sincerely hope that you learn from the tragic mistakes of our past and learn to resolve your differences through peaceful means.\n\nFarewell."
#  crisis.2473.desc:0 "We have monitored the efforts of your fleets in the fight against the [cybrex_target.GetName]. This is a struggle the galaxy cannot afford to lose, and we are heartened by your spirited resistance.\n\nThe Cybrex would like to reward the brave defenders of the [cybrex_target.GetName] by offering you complete control over one of our new battle fleets. It will obey your commands as well as any of your own fleets, though we would ask that you only employ it in battle against the [cybrex_target.GetName]."
#  crisis.2474.desc:0 "We would like to thank you for your laudable efforts against the [cybrex_target.GetName]. Now that this galactic menace has been dealt with, we must regretfully inform you that we are recalling all Cybrex vessels that are currently in service with foreign governments."
