 gray_relic.100.desc: "We input our commands into the Gray Core, and it creates a Nanites fleet similar to the one the Gray Tempest's once wielded, and since the Gray Core is under our control, this fleet is also under our control."

 gray_relic.300.name: "The birth of the scavenger robot"
 gray_relic.300.desc: "Due to an input error in our program, the Gray Core went out of control! The excessively produced mass of nanites absorbed all the junk in the nearby shipyard and reassembled itself into a giant machine mass made of junk. Luckily, no one was injured, and we were able to bring the nanites that make up this machine mass back under our control. Although this machine mass born by chance is a messy mass of junk, it seems to have a very high combat power as a ship. What should we do with this machine?"
 gray_relic.300.a: "It will be a great asset to our country."
 gray_relic.300.b: "It's too dangerous. Dismantle it immediately."

 graygoo.17.name: "Retrieving the Grey Core"
 graygoo.17.desc: "From the remains of the Grey Tempest factory, our forces recovered the §HGrey Tempest factory core§!, which appears to be the heart of the factory.\nThis core is also composed of countless nanites bonded together, and appears to have played a role in issuing commands to the Grey Tempest fleet and increasing the production of nanites. The core continued to resist even after it was recovered, so it took some time to calm it down, but we quickly reprogrammed the core and succeeded in making it obedient to us.\nFrom now on, Grey Tempest's technology will be put to good use for our benefit."
 graygoo.185.desc: "From the remains of the Dessanu factory, our forces recovered the §HDessanu Factory Core§!, which appears to be the heart of the factory.\nThis core is also composed of countless nanites bound together, and seems to have played a role in controlling the ego of the Dessanu residents, all of the nanites in Dessanu, and increasing the production of nanites. Even after being recovered, the core continued to resist, emitting signals that sounded like language.\n\n "Why! Why did you do this! What on earth have we done---" \n\nWe immediately reprogrammed the core, and succeeded in making it obedient to us.\nFrom now on, Dessanu's technology will be put to good use for us."
