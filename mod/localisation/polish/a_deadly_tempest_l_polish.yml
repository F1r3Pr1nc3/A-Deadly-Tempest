 tech_nanite_modular_engineering_desc: "Standard construction templates for our starbases are fine, but nano templates that can change themselves as needed are better, much better."
 tech_nanite_shield_rechargers: "Nanite Shield Cloud"
 tech_nanite_shield_rechargers_desc: "By spreading a cloud of specialized nanites which linger around a ship's shields, the protective field's strength is increase."
 tech_nanite_ships: "$NAME_Nanite_Ship$s"
 tech_nanite_ships_desc: "Having encountered nanite warforms and their power first-hand, it is understandable that we wish to create such vessels for our fleets. Each ship is comprised of untold billions of nanites and each is completely self sustaining. Unfortunately, their unique nature may lead to designs not as flexible as we'd hope..."
 tech_nanite_strike_craft: "Nanite $strike_craft$"
 tech_nanite_strike_craft_desc: "Our strike craft must be able to improvise, adapt, and overcome any obstacle they encounter in the field. This is much easier to accomplish when nanites can reform into any required weapon on the fly."
 tech_nanite_terraforming: "Nanite Terraforming"
 tech_nanite_terraforming_desc: "$pc_gray_goo$s have the potential to be terraformed into any world we can imagine, but it seemed they could only do so under certain conditions... until now. With the help of nanites we can greatly increase terraforming efficiency."
 tech_nanite_torpedo: "Nanite Warhead Torpedo"
 tech_nanite_torpedo_desc: "A torpedo that delivers a mass of disassembling nanites straight to the enemy ship."
 tech_nanite_workers: "Nanite Constructs"
 tech_nanite_workers_desc: "Networking certain groups of nanites into separate networks which themselves have the capability to form what ever tool they need from their appendages, combined with the processing power of countless nanites, puts them on par with if not greater than Synthetics."
