 civic_gateway_worshiper_desc:0 "Long ago an ancient precursor race, the Dessanu, came in contact with this society. The Dessanu no doubte left their mark on them as primitives with lending technology and advancing them. Revering the Dessanu as Gods, this society worships L-Gates as holy relics. Their society is structured to uphold the covenant with the Dessanu. This covenant was a vow to keep the L-Gates in their dormant state."
