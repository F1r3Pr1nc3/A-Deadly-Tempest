 ### Events
 mother_ship_hire:0 "Gray can create a nanite mothership for our use, however Gray will not create more than five for our empire; for a massive cost in resources to create the nanites for the ship./n/These ships are capable of creating smaller ships to escort them but only if the mothership is still intact. but in times of great crisis they might be able to create more.../n/Gray can create these ships no matter what form it takes as long as Gray is not reforming."

 ADT_STRIKE_CRAFT:0 "Nanite Strike Craft"
 ADT_STRIKE_CRAFT_DESC:0 "Unlike conventional strike craft, a nanite model is capable of morphing its weapons on the fly, 'hangars' becoming glorified factories that can churn out a near constant stream of the craft."

 NANITE_BEAM:0 "Nanite Beam"
 NANITE_BEAM_ADT:0 "Nanite Beam"
 NANITE_BEAM_ADT_DESC:0 "This weapon works in a similar fashion to a phase disruptor, weaponising a hyperquantum energy charge to rip through any target smaller than a planet, but is many times more destructive, as in tandem with this energy beam is a stream of destructive nanobots programmed to devour any matter unfortunate enough to come into contact."
 NANITE_ION_BEAM:0 "Nanite Beam"

 tech_adt_energymissiles_desc:0 "The Gatebuilders, whatever else they may have been, clearly had a deep enough understanding of nanomechanics to create energy spheres contained by specialized target-tracking nanites.

 tech_tactical_lgate_use_desc:0 "The L-Gates can keep us safe and secluded from the crisis currently burning the galaxy. But can we condemn the galaxy to its grim fate?
