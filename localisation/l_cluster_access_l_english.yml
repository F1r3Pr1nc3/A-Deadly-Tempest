 ### Policy

 lcluster_policy:0 "L-Cluster Access"
 policy_lcluster_policy:0 "L-Cluster Access"
 policy_lcluster_policy_desc:0 "The L-Cluster offers more than just access to unique resources but control over an entire gate network. Now it is up to us to choose how we use it."

 artifact_lgate_insight_cooldown_desc:0 "It will take some time to do this again."
 
 ### Tooltips
 
 not_in_lcluster:0 "Cannot build in L-Cluster"
