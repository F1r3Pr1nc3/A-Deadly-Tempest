 # Technology
 tech_lcluster_access:0 "L-Cluster Access Control"
 tech_lcluster_access_desc:0 "After some time and study we have discovered the means to enable or disable the L-Gate network whenever we like, so long as we have access to the master control panel situated in the $NAME_Final_Egress$ system."

 feature_lgate_access:0 "$tech_lcluster_access$"
 feature_lgate_access_desc:0 "Our empire can control the access to the $NAME_Final_Egress$ system."

 lgate_access:0 "$tech_lcluster_access$"
 lgate_access_desc:0 "This empire has control about the access to the $NAME_Final_Egress$ system in the L-Cluster."
 
 ### Policy
 lcluster_policy:0 "L-Cluster Access"
 policy_lcluster_policy:0 "$lcluster_policy$"
 policy_lcluster_policy_desc:0 "The L-Cluster offers more than just access to unique resources but control over an entire gate network. Now it is up to us to choose how we use it."
 lcluster_policy_cannot_set:0 "Cannot set L-Cluster Policy"
 lcluster_policy_cannot_set_name:0 "$lcluster_policy_cannot_set$"
 lcluster_policy_cannot_set_desc:0 "Until we gain control of the $NAME_Final_Egress$ system in the L-Cluster we cannot control access to the Cluster."
 lcluster_policy_open:0 "L-Cluster Open"
 lcluster_policy_open_desc:0 "The L-Cluster will remain open. The unparalleled tactical mobility it provides, and the ease of transport for our goods, cannot be understated, and will be used to the benefit of our empire."
 lcluster_policy_closed:0 "L-Cluster Closed"
 lcluster_policy_closed_desc:0 "The L-Cluster will remain closed. Let it serve as a place of refuge and last retreat when wholesale extinction threatens our people, and perhaps the galaxy..."

  ### Decisions
 decision_open_lcluster:0 "Open L-Cluster"
 decision_open_lcluster_desc:0 "$lcluster_policy_open_desc$"
 decision_open_lcluster_effects:0 "Will active the L-Gates, allowing for their use."
 
 decision_close_lcluster:0 "Close L-Cluster"
 decision_close_lcluster_desc:0 "$lcluster_policy_closed_desc$"
 decision_close_lcluster_effects:0 "Will deactivate the L-Gates, preventing their use." 
 
 artifact_lgate_insight_cooldown_desc:0 "It will take some time to do this again."
 
 ### Tooltips
 not_in_lcluster:0 "Cannot build in L-Cluster"
 needs_terminal_egress:0 "We must control $NAME_Final_Egress$ to control access to the L-Cluster."
 
 TECH_UNLOCK_L_GATE_ACCESS_TITLE:0 "Unlock $tech_lcluster_access$"
 TECH_UNLOCK_L_GATE_ACCESS_DESC:0 "Unlock the Policy that enables the ability to close or open the L-Cluster. Must control $NAME_Final_Egress$ to dictate policy."
